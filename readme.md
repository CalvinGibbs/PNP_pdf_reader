# PNP Slip Pdf Reader

This will enable parsing of data from a pnp pdf slip so that the data can be useful.
The data will be able to be exported to be used in other tools such as [Actual](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual-server) so that costs can be tracked and optimisations can occur

## CSV Notes
The csv format is:
id, date, payee, amount, notes

Date format is: dd.mm.yy

## TODO
- Export to CSV format that Actual supports
- Gui for user interaction
